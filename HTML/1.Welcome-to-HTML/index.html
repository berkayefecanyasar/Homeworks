<h2> The Reasons of FED Journer </h2>

<!-- Paragraf başlangıcı (Neden Bu Yol ?)-->

<p>
    I choose the Front-End Developer (FED) journey because designing the front of a website is a good choice for me.<br>
    I really like to design new and different things and this road has more design jobs than most of the others.
